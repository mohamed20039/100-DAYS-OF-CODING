// another day of javascript

//Template string

//Guess the crazy the crazy that i've learned today ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ it's a little symbol called back ticks i wasn't even what it was what but i learned and javascript is the reason

MyName = 'Mohamed'
age = 19
MyUniversity = 'Simad University'

console.log(`Hi my name is ${MyName} iam ${age} years old and i go to ${MyUniversity}`)

// null and undefined data types

// so basically null means that variable is empty and undefined means nobody knows what is inside thereðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚

let x = null
let z = undefined
console.log(x, z)

console.warn("Hey you're someone is hacking you i'm just kiddingðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚")

//How to look for the length of variable
// and you have to that this function count everything in the qoutation even the spaces

const text = 'Am doing 100 days of coding'

console.log(`The length of this text is ${text.length}`)

// how to make a string lowercase
//note iam using the above variable called text

console.log(`The lowercase of the latters is here ( ${text.toLowerCase()} )`)

console.log(`The uppercase of this variable is here ( ${text.toUpperCase()} )`)

//substring
//So basically what does substring do is to tell the number of indexes you wanna display from starting n to n

// and also there is another cool feature about this method and it's you can change the indexes that you choose to a lower case or uppercase

console.log(text.substring(0, 8).toUpperCase())


console.log(text.split(''))
